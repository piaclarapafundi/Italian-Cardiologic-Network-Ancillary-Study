# Endpoints

# Primary endpoint
#' Mean change in compositional microbiome after treatment between the two subgroups, measured in terms of microbiome entropy, i.e. Shannon’s alpha diversity index.

# Secondary endpoints
#' •	Mean change in compositional microbiome after treatment between the two subgroups, measured in terms of Chao1 species richness, Pielou evenness,  and observed species.
#' •	Mean change in TMAO metabolite after treatment between the two subgroups, measured in terms of microbiome entropy, i.e. Shannon’s alpha diversity index.
#' •	Mean change in relative abundance of species and phyla after treatment between the two subgroups.
#' •	MACEs incidence differences between the two subgroups at 7-years follow up;
#' •	Predictive factors of MACEs at 7-years follow up among clinical, laboratory and microbiome data.
